                    Since its inception in 2015, our school sponsorship program has been in very high demand.
                      Even public schools in Haiti carry a charge and are not affordable to the very poor.  
                      School age children are seen playing barefoot on the streets. In view of our mission and 
                      given the importance of education, we consider that program a top priority.  We have a long 
                      waiting list. Unfortunately, we can only accommodate very few children as a result of our 
                      limited resources. Through donations, we are able to pay the registration fee, tuition, school 
                      uniforms, books and the teachers` salary. Throughout the year, we collect bookbags, and other 
                      school supplies to distribute to the students at the beginning of each academic year.  Starting 
                      with 21 students, our program has grown to 25 students ages 5 to 23, who are learning and advancing 
                      in grades. To date, we have 3 graduates, 1 in carpentry, 1 in plumbing and 1 in baking and 
                      pastries who are making a living with their crafts.  This sponsorship not only brings change 
                      to one person, but it strengthens an entire community.

                    Along with sponsoring their education, our hope, in the future, is to also provide one meal a day to our 
                    students and continue our support until they reach their final professional goal.

                    We are excited to announce our new initiative, Nurses for Hope, in which we are sponsoring four nursing students. 
                    Our hope is that we will open a local clinic in which these four nurses with the help of doctors will provide 
                    necessary preventative and emergency care, as well as public health education.

                    With political upheaval, social unrest, the constantly rising cost of living, in addition to unemployment, food has 
                    become a luxury in Haiti.  Since our first food distribution in 2008,  HACA created an annual food distribution program 
                    to help alleviate the hunger crisis.  We purchase non-perishable staples such as rice, beans, cornmeal, spaghetti, 
                    canned salmon, cooking oil, and soap from a Haitian supplier.  With the help of volunteers, the food is portioned, 
                    packed in bags, and distributed to the neediest families identified by the communities` church leaders.  The program 
                    has grown so much that we have had to do it twice a year and serve two different groups to help more needy families. 
                    At our last event in December 2018, we distributed food for two weeks to 400 families of at least 5 people.  Despite 
                    our precautions, the number of families that show up to get food is always greater than the number expected.  It`s 
                    painful to turn down needy families.  We hope to be able to serve as many of them as possible in the future.

                    The problem of health care is very serious in Haiti, but it is worse in underdeveloped mountainous areas where bad roads 
                    make travel difficult.  It takes hours to get to a hospital, and those who need urgent care very often die before they 
                    can be helped. Only those who have money can afford private care.  The great majority of the people in the area do not 
                    have basic preventive care.  The only clinic in the area closed four years ago.  In July 2012, HACA organized a very 
                    successful ambulatory clinic in Haiti where we partnered with local and Haitian American doctors to provide eye, 
                    pediatric, and general care to several communities. Over 400 families attended.  That program was repeated two more times.  
                    Our hope is to reopen the clinic and provide urgent and regular preventive care to the communities of Bellevue de la Montagne.

                    The problem of health care is very serious in Haiti, but it is worse in the mountainous rural areas where bad roads make 
                    travel difficult. There are no local clinics in the area. It takes hours to get to a hospital, and those who need urgent 
                    care very often die before they can be helped. We started a new initiative, Nurses For Hope, in 2019 with the idea of 
                    preparing the nurses who will staff the healthcare facility we plan to open in one of the communities we serve. With 
                    the help of doctors, our nurses will provide preventive and emergency care. They will also provide public health 
                    education to the surrounding communities. We started with four young ladies and now have five nursing students.
